The Barbican has become my new front room recently during the excellent Urban Wandering program which is currently showing focussing on london. On friday Will Self, Lynsey Hanley and Andrea Luka Zimmerman discussed architecture, social housing and psychogeography. Andrea Luka Zimmerman's film Estate was shown which documents the end and of an iconic estate in Haggerston demolished to make way for more luxury flats. The discussion was chaired by film curator Gareth Evans. On Saturday the series continued with Mike Leigh's Naked. The film was projected using Mike Leigh's original 35mm reel and on Monday with a special screening of the filmmaker John Smith's London.
