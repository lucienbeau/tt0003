At the weekend I checked out the Firstsite Gallery in Colchester which is a new contemporary art gallery in Essex. The exhibition 'Xerography' focusses on work made by artists and artists groups that have used the photocopier as the central process in their work(s). The exhibition has an amazing collection of work including really rare original works by Sol Le Witt and Bruno Munari's Xerografia bookwork amongst many others. Here's some images from the show and exhibition entrance. Check more info here: Firstsite
